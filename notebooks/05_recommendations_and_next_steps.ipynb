    "- Bestseller lists are not evenly distributed by genre.\n",

    "- The genre share trend over time shows whether demand is stable or shifting.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2) Pricing clusters into a typical “bestseller band”\n",
    "- Bestsellers tend to sit within a narrow price range.\n",

    "**Supporting visual:** `reports/price_distribution_by_genre.png`\n",

    "- Review volume varies widely across titles.\n",
    "- High-review books often represent high market visibility and reach.\n",

    "### 4) Ratings represent satisfaction but do not guarantee popularity alone\n",
    "- High ratings are common among bestsellers, but review volume differentiates top-performing titles.\n",
    "- The strongest segment combines high ratings and high reviews.\n",

    "**Supporting visual:** `reports/rating_vs_reviews.png`\n",

    "---\n",

    "### 5) Repeat authors indicate persistence and lower risk\n",
    "- Authors appearing across multiple years represent a proven demand base.\n",
