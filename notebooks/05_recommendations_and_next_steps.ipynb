    "## Key Findings\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1) Genre dominates bestseller composition\n",
    "- Bestseller lists are not evenly distributed by genre.\n",
    "- One or two genres typically account for a large share of top titles.\n",
    "- The genre share trend over time shows whether demand is stable or shifting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supporting visual:** `reports/genre_share_over_time.png`  \n",
    "**Supporting visual:** `reports/overall_genre_share.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2) Pricing clusters into a typical “bestseller band”\n",
    "- Bestsellers tend to sit within a narrow price range.\n",
    "- Some genres show systematically higher or lower typical prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supporting visual:** `reports/price_distribution_by_genre.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3) Review volume is a strong popularity signal\n",
    "- Review volume varies widely across titles.\n",
    "- High-review books often represent high market visibility and reach.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4) Ratings represent satisfaction but do not guarantee popularity alone\n",
    "- High ratings are common among bestsellers, but review volume differentiates top-performing titles.\n",
    "- The strongest segment combines high ratings and high reviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supporting visual:** `reports/rating_vs_reviews.png`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5) Repeat authors indicate persistence and lower risk\n",
    "- Authors appearing across multiple years represent a proven demand base.\n",
    "- This can reduce risk when planning releases, promotions, or partnerships.\n",

    "## Recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 1 — Focus acquisition/marketing on dominant genre categories\n",
    "**Action:** Prioritise budget and promotional slots on the genres with the highest and most stable bestseller share.  \n",
    "**Why:** These genres demonstrate sustained demand and are more likely to generate repeat bestseller candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 2 — Use “bestseller price bands” rather than guessing pricing\n",
    "**Action:** Define 2–3 recommended price bands based on historical bestseller pricing (e.g., low / mid / premium).  \n",
    "**Why:** This aligns pricing strategy to market norms and reduces the risk of mispricing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 3 — Build a “high-performing segment” scorecard for new titles\n",
    "**Action:** Track early indicators for new releases using:\n",
    "- rating thresholds\n",
    "- review growth rate\n",
    "- genre benchmarks  \n",
    "**Why:** Early signals can guide promotion spend and inventory decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 4 — Identify repeat authors and build partnership strategy\n",
    "**Action:** Create a shortlist of authors with multi-year appearances and prioritise:\n",
    "- exclusive launches\n",
    "- bundled promotions\n",
    "- repeat-series marketing  \n",
    "**Why:** Repeat authors represent proven demand and lower uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommendation 5 — Optimise visibility mechanics (reviews strategy)\n",
    "**Action:** Improve review capture strategy (ethically) by:\n",
    "- post-purchase email prompts\n",
    "- review reminders in packaging\n",
    "- early-reader programmes  \n",
    "**Why:** Review volume is a strong popularity proxy and supports ranking visibility.\n"

    "   - Include Top 500 or category-level bestseller data\n",
    "   - Add publisher, format (hardcover/paperback/ebook), and marketing signals if available\n",

    "2) **Add sales and profitability measures**\n",
    "   - Integrate internal sales volume, margin, ad spend, and conversion metrics\n",

    "3) **Model early success indicators**\n",
    "   - Build a simple predictive model to estimate “bestseller likelihood” using early ratings/reviews velocity\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **Segment by sub-genres and formats**\n",
    "   - Fiction vs Non-Fiction is broad; subcategories may reveal more targeted strategy opportunities\n",

    "5) **Test strategy changes**\n",
    "   - Run controlled experiments on pricing bands and review-generation tactics\n"
